# audio-to-text
No idea. But definitely doing something

# Requirements
audio-no.py
1. tflearn
2. scikit-image
3. File: https://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_speech_recognition_demo/blob/master/speech_data.py
4. librosa
5. h5py

# Instructions
use GPU version of TensorFlow & tflearn. In my case, it took more than 20hrs to train & it crashed several times. You'll need a NVidia GPU for using CUDA & CuNN
